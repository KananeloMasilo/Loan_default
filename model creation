Model creation

At the beginning of this project we cleaned our data and performed all preprocessing steps, so now that our data was ready to be fitted to the model,
we randomly chose between numerous models like Support vector machine (SVM),
Logistic regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest. These are supervised machine learning, models for classification.
We also realized that the problem we are trying to solve consists of dichotomous data that is why we chose classification models. 
We followed the following distinct steps to create the best model to suit our project:
1.	Splitting of dataset into training and test data
2.	We fitted the training data that we split before to different models to perceive how our chosen models will behave.
3.	We also fitted the models with test data to see their accuracy score, so that we can make better decision when concluding about the final model to use.
4.	 We did model tuning again, this time with different hyper parameter sizes to see how accurate our models would be in many and diverse subsets of data. 
As a result, we assured that it generalizes well to future data while also boosting the model's accuracy. This was also fulfilled with cross validation.
5.	We also chose some models randomly under supervised machine learning classification that include, Logistic regression, Decision Tree,
Random Forest and Support vector machine. 

6.	Among all these trained models the model with high accuracy after being fed data, 
is the one that will provide final results of whether a customer can be granted loan or not. 
In this project We decided to utilize Random Forest classifier model because,
•	it has fewer execution time 
•	higher accuracy than other used models
•	it is used in banking to control loan default 
•	easy to use and flexible
