Purpose of the project

•	This project is intended to predict whether a loan can be offered to bank customers or not. This is because a bank may have default loan causing loss of money, so this project will solve this problem.

•	Using Machine-Learning, it will be easy for the designed model to know customers to offer loan to. It will take a very short time to decide on offering loans.

•	This project will have a Machine Learning system that will be capable of learning. Meaning the systems will no longer capture and store data only, Instead they will also connect together with other systems to learn from the stored data to solve problems, which will be very difficult for human beings to solve.

•	The system will be used to solve real life problems, that are very risky to other businesses not specifically banks as such.

•	To aid with the use of systematic approach to solve problems, using reasonable actions and decisions.

•	It is often difficult to make decisions with larger amount of dataset, but with the use of these designed machine-learning models will be very easy to make decision.
